## 💡 Technical Notes

### Known Issues
1. **Dev server file watch limit** - Sandbox environment limitation, works fine locally
2. **Chunk size warnings** - Can be optimized with code splitting
3. **Missing error boundaries** - Should add for production

### Performance Considerations
- Large bundle size (~1.8MB) - needs code splitting
- Image optimization needed for gallery
- Consider CDN for static assets
- Implement caching strategy

### Security Considerations
- ✅ CSRF protection via tRPC
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (Drizzle ORM)
- ✅ XSS protection (React)
- ⚠️ Rate limiting needed for API
- ⚠️ Input validation could be stricter
