## Conclusion

The test expansion initiative has successfully increased test coverage from ~5-10% to ~25-30%, with a strong foundation of E2E tests covering critical user flows. The next priority should be integration tests for Stripe payments, S3 uploads, and OAuth flows, followed by comprehensive component testing.

**Key Recommendations:**
1. Implement integration tests for payment and file upload flows
2. Add component tests for UI library
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
4. Establish test database with seeding scripts
5. Implement visual regression testing
6. Create comprehensive test documentation

**Success Metrics:**
- All E2E tests passing consistently
- Integration tests for critical business logic
- 50%+ code coverage within 2 months
- Zero production bugs related to tested features
- Automated test execution on every PR
